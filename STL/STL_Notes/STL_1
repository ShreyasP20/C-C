STL stands for Standard Template Library
STL-contains container; Iterators; Algorithms; Functors.

Containers-Sequential Ordered and Unordered 
Sequential = vectors Stack Queue
Ordered = Maps , Multimap, Set , Multiset
Unordered= Unordered Map Undordered Set

Nested Containers-Hard But EAZY TO APPLY 

Iterators- Point to memory address of Containers<BASCIALLY POINTERS FOR STL>

Algorithms-Complex Algorithms are implemented already SO JUST USE THEM!!!!

Functors-Classes Which can act as Functions
